👨‍🔬 About Me

Hello! I am Jiahao Zhang (张家豪), a graduate student at Beijing Institute of Technology, majoring in Software Engineering, with a strong focus on computer vision and remote sensing-based small object detection.

Currently, I am conducting research as part of a collaborative project with Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST), aiming to develop advanced brain-inspired satellite-based target detection systems. My recent work includes a first-author publication at MMM 2025 and a national invention patent application on image pulse encoding based on the Census transform.
